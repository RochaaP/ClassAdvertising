                                    <li>Why do we use Zoom?
                                        <p>The main idea of using zoom is to connect a student and an instructor more relaibility. 
                                            Let's think of a situation where student is going through a paper and he/ she got a problem, 
                                            now they don't have to be clueless. 
                                            They can place an appoinment to the corresponding instructor using our mtute.lk page.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Then an instructor can create a meeting with zoom using our API and send the join url to the student who placed an appoinment.
                                        </p>

                        <p>Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in

                        either through your online account management page or by contacting cskelum@gmail.com

                        Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
            
                        <p>mtute.lk will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give
                        you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>

                                    <li>Why do we use Zoom?
                                        <p>The main idea of using zoom is to connect a student and an instructor more relaibility. 
                                            Let's think of a situation where student is going through a paper and he/ she got a problem, 
                                            now they don't have to be clueless. 
                                            They can place an appoinment to the corresponding instructor using our mtute.lk page.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Then an instructor can create a meeting with zoom using our API and send the join url to the student who placed an appoinment.
                                        </p>
